## Example Usage

Here is an example of converting 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): C
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 25.00¬∞ Celsius is equal to 77.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.
```

Another example, converting from Kelvin to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 373.15
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): K
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 373.15¬∞ Kelvin is equal to 212.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.
```
