# SCT_SD_1
# Temperature Converter üå°Ô∏è
A simple command-line Java application that converts temperature values between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

This program provides a straightforward way to perform common temperature conversions directly from your terminal.

## Features

  - **Three-Way Conversion:** Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts the user for all necessary inputs in a clear and step-by-step manner.
  - **Formatted Output:** Displays the conversion result rounded to two decimal places for readability.
  - **Lightweight & Simple:** A single-file Java application with no external dependencies.

-----

## How to Use

To run this program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### 1\. Compile the Program

Navigate to the directory containing the `TemperatureConverter1.java` file and compile it using the following command:

```sh
javac TemperatureConverter1.java
```

### 2\. Run the Program

Once compiled, run the application from your terminal:

```sh
java TemperatureConverter1
```

The program will then guide you through the process by asking for the temperature value and the units for conversion.

-----

## Example Usage

Here is an example of converting 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): C
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 25.00¬∞ Celsius is equal to 77.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.
```

Another example, converting from Kelvin to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 373.15
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): K
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 373.15¬∞ Kelvin is equal to 212.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.

# SCT_SD_3
# Sudoku Solver üß©
A command-line Java application that automatically solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

This program takes a 2D integer array representing an unsolved Sudoku grid and fills in the missing numbers to find a valid solution.

Features
Algorithmic Solver: Implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions.

Dynamic Input: Easily change the puzzle by modifying the input grid directly in the source code.

Clear Output: Displays the unsolved puzzle first, followed by the neatly formatted solved grid.

Unsolvable Detection: Reports if a given puzzle has no valid solution.

Self-Contained: A single-file Java application with no external dependencies.

Algorithm Used: Backtracking
The program solves the puzzle by exploring every possible placement of numbers and "backtracking" when a path leads to an invalid state.

Find an Empty Cell: It scans the grid for a cell with a 0.

Try Numbers 1-9: It attempts to place a number from 1 to 9 in that cell.

Check Validity: For each attempt, it checks if the number is valid in its current row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.

Recurse: If the number is valid, it recursively calls itself to continue solving the rest of the puzzle.

Backtrack: If a recursive path fails (i.e., leads to a dead end), it undoes the move (resets the cell to 0) and tries the next number.

This process continues until a full, valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

How to Use
To run this program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. Compile the Program
Navigate to the directory containing the SudokuSolver.java file and compile it using the following command:

Bash

javac SudokuSolver.java
2. Run the Program
Once compiled, run the application from your terminal:

Bash

java SudokuSolver
The program will print the unsolved and solved versions of the puzzle defined in the main method.

Example Output
The program will display the following output for the default puzzle:
# Unsolved Sudoku Puzzle:
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0

# E-commerce Product Scraper üõí

A Java application designed to scrape product information‚Äîspecifically names, prices, and ratings‚Äîfrom the e-commerce practice website `books.toscrape.com`. The extracted data is then neatly organized and saved into a CSV file.

This program serves as a practical example of web scraping and data extraction using Java and the Jsoup library.

## Features

  - **Web Page Scraping:** Connects to a target URL and fetches its HTML content.
  - **Data Extraction:** Parses the HTML to extract specific product details: name, price, and star rating.
  - **CSV Export:** Stores the collected data in a structured, easy-to-read CSV file named `products.csv`.
  - **Robust Parsing:** Uses the powerful Jsoup library to navigate the HTML DOM with CSS selectors.
  - **Clean Data:** Includes logic to format and clean the extracted data (e.g., removing currency symbols).

-----

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** and **Apache Maven** installed. This project also depends on an external library called **Jsoup**.

### Jsoup Dependency

If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file to include Jsoup in your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jsoup</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsoup</artifactId>
    <version>1.17.2</version>
</dependency>
```

-----

## How to Use

### 1\. Set Up a Maven Project

Create a new Maven project in your IDE and add the Jsoup dependency as shown above.

### 2\. Add the Java Files

Place the `Product.java` and `WebScraper.java` files into the appropriate source folder (e.g., `src/main/java/your/package/name/`).

### 3\. Run the Application

Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal and run the application using the Maven command:

```sh
# Compile and run the main class
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="WebScraper"
```

The program will connect to the website, scrape the data, and create a `products.csv` file in the root directory of your project.

-----

## Example Output (`products.csv`)

The generated CSV file will look like this:

```csv
Name,Price,Rating
A Light in the Attic,51.77,3/5 Stars
Tipping the Velvet,53.74,1/5 Stars
Soumission,50.10,1/5 Stars
Sharp Objects,47.82,4/5 Stars
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,54.23,5/5 Stars
...
```

-----

## Technology

  - **Language:** **Java**
  - **Build Tool:** **Maven**
  - **External Libraries:**
  - **Jsoup:** For fetching and parsing HTML.
  - **Core Libraries:** `java.io.FileWriter` for writing to the CSV file.
