# SCT_SD_1
# Temperature Converter üå°Ô∏è
A simple command-line Java application that converts temperature values between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

This program provides a straightforward way to perform common temperature conversions directly from your terminal.

## Features

  - **Three-Way Conversion:** Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts the user for all necessary inputs in a clear and step-by-step manner.
  - **Formatted Output:** Displays the conversion result rounded to two decimal places for readability.
  - **Lightweight & Simple:** A single-file Java application with no external dependencies.

-----

## How to Use

To run this program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### 1\. Compile the Program

Navigate to the directory containing the `TemperatureConverter1.java` file and compile it using the following command:

```sh
javac TemperatureConverter1.java
```

### 2\. Run the Program

Once compiled, run the application from your terminal:

```sh
java TemperatureConverter1
```

The program will then guide you through the process by asking for the temperature value and the units for conversion.

-----

## Example Usage

Here is an example of converting 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): C
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 25.00¬∞ Celsius is equal to 77.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.
```

Another example, converting from Kelvin to Fahrenheit:

```
Enter the temperature value: 373.15
Enter the original unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): K
Enter the target unit to convert to (C, F, K): F

Result: 373.15¬∞ Kelvin is equal to 212.00¬∞ Fahrenheit.

I've picked a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!

Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 37
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 32
üéâ Congratulations! You guessed the number!
It took you 4 tries.

# SCT_SD_3
# Sudoku Solver üß©
A command-line Java application that automatically solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

This program takes a 2D integer array representing an unsolved Sudoku grid and fills in the missing numbers to find a valid solution.

Features
Algorithmic Solver: Implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions.

Dynamic Input: Easily change the puzzle by modifying the input grid directly in the source code.

Clear Output: Displays the unsolved puzzle first, followed by the neatly formatted solved grid.

Unsolvable Detection: Reports if a given puzzle has no valid solution.

Self-Contained: A single-file Java application with no external dependencies.

Algorithm Used: Backtracking
The program solves the puzzle by exploring every possible placement of numbers and "backtracking" when a path leads to an invalid state.

Find an Empty Cell: It scans the grid for a cell with a 0.

Try Numbers 1-9: It attempts to place a number from 1 to 9 in that cell.

Check Validity: For each attempt, it checks if the number is valid in its current row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.

Recurse: If the number is valid, it recursively calls itself to continue solving the rest of the puzzle.

Backtrack: If a recursive path fails (i.e., leads to a dead end), it undoes the move (resets the cell to 0) and tries the next number.

This process continues until a full, valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

How to Use
To run this program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1. Compile the Program
Navigate to the directory containing the SudokuSolver.java file and compile it using the following command:

Bash

javac SudokuSolver.java
2. Run the Program
Once compiled, run the application from your terminal:

Bash

java SudokuSolver
The program will print the unsolved and solved versions of the puzzle defined in the main method.

Example Output
The program will display the following output for the default puzzle:
# Unsolved Sudoku Puzzle:
5 3 0 | 0 7 0 | 0 0 0
6 0 0 | 1 9 5 | 0 0 0

# Java E-commerce Web Scraper 

A practical Java web scraper built with the **Jsoup** library. This project connects to the e-commerce sandbox website [books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com/), extracts product information, and saves it to a local CSV file.  

This project was created as part of my software development internship with **SkillCraft Technology**.
